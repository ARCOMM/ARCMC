# Reporting an issue

## Before reporting

If you have found an issue with Mars please make sure that Mars really is the cause of the problem. To do this try to reproduce the issue with using only `@CBA_A3` and `@mars` on a newly created mission.

Indicate if the issue appears on stable or development version. In case it is the development version, please also include the commit SHA-1 hash.

**Please note:**
- It's not a valid to simply remove `@mars` from the mod list to confirm that Mars is the culprit.
- If the error happens when using a **third-party mod** contact the author of the appropriate mod and report the issue there.

## Reporting the issue

Head over to the [Mars GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/marseditor/Mars/issues) and press the [new issue](https://github.com/marseditor/Mars/issues/new) button in the top right corner. Add a descriptive title and complete the issue template.

A video of the issue might be helpful in resolving it faster.
