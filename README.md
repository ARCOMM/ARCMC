Mars is designed with large communities in mind. When you're the game master for a mission, you take on a big responsibility to deliver a fun experience to the players. Current implementations for real-time control don't offer enough detail and cause a lot of headaches when trying to do very specific things. The goal of Mars is to create a platform that's extensible and robust allowing communities to create their own additions and customise Mars to suit their needs.

## Coding Guidelines
This project follows the [ACE3 coding guidelines](http://ace3mod.com/wiki/development/coding-guidelines.html). Here's some basic rules:
* Addons **must be modular** with as few dependencies as possible
* Use 4 spaces for indentation
* Use camel case
* Use the standard [function header](http://ace3mod.com/wiki/development/coding-guidelines.html#headers)
* Braces should be on the same line
